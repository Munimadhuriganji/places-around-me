# Places Around Me
## AIM:
To develop a website to display details about the places around my house.

## Design Steps:

### Step 1:Create a folder 'static' under the project folder 'myproj'

### Step 2:In 'static',create another folder 'html',under which the file 'index.html' should be created.

### Step 3:Go to google maps and take a screenshot of your home on it along with some places around it.

### step 4:Go to image-maps.com and make 5 locations on it using the shapes used in maps.

### step 5:Copy the html code for the map and add it to 'index.html'

### step 6:Create the html documents to be displayed when clicked on the location in the image map.

### step 7:Take screenshots of the output.

### step 8:Push it to 'README.md' and push it to the repository.
